# Bash Scripting Basics

Here, we list some basic bash syntax with a brief explanation. It is a good starting point if you are a beginner.
## Syntax	Explanation
#!/bin/bash	Used to tell the operating system the path it should use to interpret the file.
bash file.sh	Used to execute the script in the terminal.
./file.sh	Used to execute the script if it is executable.
#	Used to make comments in the script.
&&	logical AND operator.
| |	logical OR operator.
$#	Used to expands the number of arguments passed to the script.
$0	Used to expands to the name of the shell.
$1, $2	Used as an input param­eter that you can add when running script.
exit [0-255]	Used to exit the script and return the number from 0 to 255.
$	Used for parameters and variables.
()	Used for running commands in a subshell.
$()	Used to save the output of commands.
(())	Used for arithmetic.
$(())	Used to retrieve the output of arithmetic expressions.
[]	Used in filename expansion and string manipulation.
<( )	It is very similar to a pipe and used for process substitution.
{ }	Used to expand sequences.
${ }	Used for string manipulation and variable interpolation.
|	Used to run multiple commands together.|
>	Used to send output to a file.
>>	Used to append output to a file.
;	Used to separate multiple commands.
<	Used to get input from a file.
~	Expands to the home directory.
~/.bashrc	Read by every non-login shell.
/etc/profile	Executed automatically at login.
File Test Operators

Here, we will list some helping testing operators for permissions, size, date, file type, or existence in the bash script.
Operators	Explanation
-e	To test if a file exists.
-f	To test if a given file is a regular file.
-d	To test if the file is a directory.
-b	To test if the file is a block device.
-s	To test if the file is not zero sizes.
-L	To test if the file is a symbolic link.
-S	To test if the file is a socket.
-r	To test if the file has read permission.
-w	To test if the file has write permission.
-x	To test if the file has execute permission.
-g	Set group id on file or directory.
-u	Set user id on file or directory.
-k	Set a sticky bit.
-O	You are the owner of the file.
f1 -nt f2	file f1 is newer than f2.
f1 -ot f2	file f1 is older than f2
Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used in bash to compare two strings to check if they are equal or not. Here, we will list some comparison operators including, string, and integer operators.
Integer Operators
Operators	Explanation
-eq	is equal to
-ne	is not equal to
-gt	is greater than
-ge	is greater than or equal to
-lt	is less than
-le	is less than or equal to
String Operators
Operators	Explanation
=	is equal to
==	is equal to
!=	is not equal to
<	less than
<=	is less than or equal to
>	greater than
>=	is greater than or equal to
-z	string is null
-n	string is not null
Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are shortened as ‘regexp' or ‘regex'. They are strings of characters that define a search pattern. It can be used as a search or search & replace operation.
Expressions	Explanation
.	Matches any single character.
?	The preceding item is optional and will be matched, at most, once.
*	The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
+	The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
{N}	The preceding item is matched exactly N times.
{N,}	The preceding item is matched N or more times.
^	Matches the empty string at the beginning of a line.
$	Matches the empty string at the end of a line.
[a-d]	Matches any one character in the range a-d.
Loops and Conditions

A loop is a statement in a bash programming language that allows code to be repeatedly executed. You can set specific conditions during the script execution.
Loops	Explanation
if then fi	Used to test a condition.
if then else fi	Used to test a condition and use a fallback if the test fails.
if then elif else fi	Used to test a condition and use a fallback if all tests fail.
for do done	Iterate over a list of values.
while do done	Used to performs a given set of commands an unknown number of times as long as the given condition evaluates to true.
until do done	Used to execute a given set of commands as long as the given condition evaluates to false.
sleep time	Wait for a specified amount of time before continuing through the script.
break	Used to exit from the while or for loop but continue the rest of the script.
continue	Used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
Bash Arrays and Functions
Array	Explanation
array=("elements of array")	Used to create an array of strings.
${array[0]}	Used to get the first element of the array.
${array[*]}	Used to get all values in the array.
${array[-1]}	Get the last value in the array.
${array[@]}	Expand all of the array elements.
shift	Move argument from $2 to $1.
function() { content-of-function }	Used to define a function.
alias	Used to list all aliases defined in the current session.
alias alias='any command'	Used to define an alias.
